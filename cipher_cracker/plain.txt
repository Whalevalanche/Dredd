        It was one of those clear, bright summer mornings we get in the early spring in california before the high fogs set in. The rains are over. The hills are still green and in the valley across the hollywood hills you can see snow on the high mountains. The fur stores are advertising their annual sales. The call houses that specialize in sixteen-year-old virgins are doing a land-office business. And in beverly hills the Jacaranda trees are beginning to bloom. I had been stalking the blue bottle fly for five minutes, waiting for him to sit down. He didn't want to sit down. He just wanted to do wing-overs and sing the prologue to Pagliacci. I had the fly swatter poised in midair and I was all set. There was a patch of bright sun light on the corner of the desk and I knew that sooner or later that was where he was going to light. But when he did, I didn't even see him at first. The buzzings stopped and there he was. And then the phone rang. I reached for it inch by inch with a slow and patient left hand. I lifted the phone slowly and spoke into it softly: hold the line a moment, please. I laid the phone down gently on the brown blotter. He was still there, shining and blue-green and full of sin. I took a deep breath and swung. What was left of him sailed halfway across the room and dropped to the carpet. I went over and picked him up by his good wing and dropped him into the waste basket. Thank for waiting, I said into the phone. Is this My. Marlowe, the detective? It was a small, rather hurried, little-girlish voice. I said it was Mr. Marlowe, the detective. How much do you charge for your services, Mr. Marlowe?
